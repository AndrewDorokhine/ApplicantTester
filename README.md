# CMPT305-ApplicantTester
Use of Object-Oriented template method to create a system that tests an applicant to see if they can get into a given university department

This project was written as part of the final exam in Computing 305, a course about the principles of Object Oriented programming. It focused mainly on Java and taught design patterns for solving certain problems; in this case, the Template Method was used to check if a university applicant had the needed credentials to be admitted into a given university department. The university has a number of general requirements, while each department has specific ones. All of these must be satisfied for any given department.
